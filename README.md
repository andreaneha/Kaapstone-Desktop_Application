Use:
--------------------------
Pulls the last data that was pushed to https://kaapstone.herokuapp.com/
Displays the data in a graphical way to show relative voltage output of the sensors

Future work
---------------------------
- Use sensor calibration equations to determine the exact force detected by each sensor
- Fix axis 
- overlay a window so that the data is displayed in a foot shape instead of a square shape
- show an icon for location of COP 
- create additional graphs for trends over time

Compile
------------------------------------
python KaapstoneApplication.py
